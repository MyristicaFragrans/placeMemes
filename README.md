# placeMemes
An open source project to host images easily, built specifically for pxls.space instances
## Requirements

* Any web server that handles MIME type .php (I use Apache 2)
* PHP Version >= 4.3.0
* Some images (you can use pixabay.com for testing)

## Downloading Releases
Just download the whole git repo and delete README.md and LICENSE.md. It's not complex enough for a formal download.

## Building
Seriously, just have apache2 and php. That's it.

## Installing
Move `/index.php` and `/img/` to your web server directory. For Apache2, this is typically `/var/www/html/`.

## Contributing
Just fork the repository and please be descriptive with your changes.  
If you are not sure if something would be a good change, open an issue.

## Testing
upload random images and see if it works. If it works, make a pull request.

## Why are you bad at coding?
This is just a git repo. This is never supposed to go further than the origional page.

## Where is the official page, anyway?
Cannot disclose. If you are allowed to have access to it, you'd know it.
