# placeMemes
An open source project to host images easily, built specifically for pxls.space instances
## Requirements

* Any web server that handles MIME type .php (I use Apache 2)
* PHP Version >= 4.3.0
* Some images (you can use pixabay.com for testing)

## Installing
Move `/index.php` and `/img/` to your web server directory. For Apache2, this is typically `/var/www/html/`.

## Contributing
Just fork the repository and please be descriptive with your changes.  
If you are not sure if something would be a good change, open an issue.
